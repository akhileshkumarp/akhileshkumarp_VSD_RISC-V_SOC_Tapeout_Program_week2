## What is a System-on-Chip (SoC)?

A **System-on-Chip (SoC)** is an integrated circuit that consolidates all essential components of a computer system onto a single semiconductor die. Unlike traditional computer architectures that use separate chips for different functions, an SoC combines the processor, memory, input/output interfaces, and specialized processing units into one compact package.

### Key Advantages of SoC Design:
- **Space Efficiency**: Dramatically reduces the physical footprint of electronic systems
- **Power Optimization**: Minimizes power consumption through integrated design and shorter interconnects
- **Cost Reduction**: Lower manufacturing costs due to fewer discrete components
- **Performance Enhancement**: Reduced latency between components improves overall system speed
- **Reliability**: Fewer interconnections result in higher system reliability
